# Design Sketch
I still need a lot of practice with CSS. Sass has gotten much easier and it's yet another thing that makes web design so amazing these days. All of the technology that gets used during the process is mind blowing as well as daunting (at first).

I'm def getting better with node.js setup using express but still mainly with static pages. Even though that's all that most front end designers need, I want to focus on back end and eventually move to full stack. I'm confident in my ability to learn moder design techniques and create aesthetically pleasing products but I want to focus my learning on something more objective.
